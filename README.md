#Description

Ok... soo... this is the explanation. You Ready? Because it's super useful and cool. Firstly, we grab images from instagram (with the Instagram API) with the tags "Mchacks". Secondly, we display it all in our view and give the user the ability to click a picture, and see it in it's glorious max-width:750px view. But we don't stop there, oh not at all my sweet sweet reviewer. Upon selecting the image we gather data from it using Google cloud APIs. This data includes finding faces in each image, getting the most prominant colors of the images, and getting the smart labels of the images. We do nothing with the labels, we just got them to prove that we could. Definately not because we didnt have any good ideas on how to implemenet it. However, we did implement the other data. Everytime a user clicks an image, we re-style the webpage dynamically and accordingly (using the two most prominant colors of the selected image as our baseline). By tracking the faces, we grace each person who appears on our site with some super cool retro sunglasses... at least that was the plan, for now it's just a rectangle around their face. The end. Enjoy
